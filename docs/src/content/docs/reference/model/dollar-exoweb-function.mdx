title: The $exoweb function
description: A function that can be used to define or extend a client-side entity model.
---

The `$exoweb` function is used to create or augment a client-side model
(see [Entity Model Overview](/ExoWeb/guides/entity-model-overview)).

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Aside>
The call to `$exoweb` to establish a client-side model _may_ be generated by server-side code.
</Aside>

The `$exoweb` function coordinates initialization of types and model instances based on embedded data
and/or calls to the server to load data, and invokes callbacks at different phases in the process to
support customization of the model and/or UI. Below is the schema for the data that the function
accepts, along with a brief explanation of each option.

```js
{
	// Callback that is invoked after the context is created
	// (or immediatly if it already exists)
	init: function(context) { },

	// Enables "extending" the global context after it and the model have been created.
	// note: The `contextReady` events will not fire until the `callback` has been invoked.
	extendContext: function(context, callback) { },

	// Context ready callbacks are invoked after after the context and model
	// have been created and all `extendContext` callbacks have been invoked.
	contextReady: function(context) { },

	// DOM ready fires after context ready _and_ the DOM ready event.
	// note: If `autoActivation` is enabled, then templates are activated
	// _before_ dom ready callbacks are invoked.
	domReady: function() { },

	// Information about the server, notably: `TimeZoneOffset`
	serverInfo: { },

	// Array of types to load
	types: [ ... ],

	// Embedded state
	types: { ... },
	model: { ... },
	instances: { ... },
	conditions: { ... },
	changes: { ... },
}
```

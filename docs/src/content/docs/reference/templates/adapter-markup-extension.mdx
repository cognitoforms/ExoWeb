title: Adapter markup extension
description: A model-aware binding markup extension.
---

The `{@}` markup extension (known as "Adapter") provides enhanced binding to a model property.

It serves as a way of interfacing with the property that is referenced. It does not represent just
the value of the property, though that can be obtained in a nested template using various properties
(`rawValue`, `systemValue`, `displayValue`). The purpose of the adapter is to provide metadata about
the property, such as the label, the data type, its options, validation, etc., which can be used to
implement more general purpose UI (which is really useful for dynamic forms).

Example:
```html
<div dataview:data="{@ Some.Path}">
```

The value that is provided to the dataview has a number of properties that can be used in nested
data binding expressions:

- `displayValue`: The value of the property, formatted as human-readable text.
- `rawValue`: The raw value of the property.
- `systemValue`: A unique value, ex: the id if the source is an entity.
- `options`: A list of option adapters if the property supports allowed values.
- `firstError`: The first error condition, if there are any.
- `label`: The property's label.
- `helptext`: The property's help text.

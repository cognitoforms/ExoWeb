title: Adapter markup extension
description: A model-aware binding markup extension.
---

The `{@}` markup extension provides enhanced binding to a model property.

Example:
```html
<div dataview:data="{@ Some.Path}">
```

The value that is provided to the dataview has a number of properties that can be used in nested
data binding expressions:

- `displayValue`: The value of the property, formatted as human-readable text.
- `rawValue`: The raw value of the property.
- `systemValue`: A unique value, ex: the id if the source is an entity.
- `options`: A list of option adapters if the property supports allowed values.
- `firstError`: The first error condition, if there are any.
- `label`: The property's label.
- `helptext`: The property's help text.

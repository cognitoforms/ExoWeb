title: Binding markup extension
description: A markup extension that supports two-way data binding.
---

The `{binding}` markup extension supports two-way reactive data binding for a named property or path
(similar to `v-model` in Vue.js).

It sets the target attribute to the initial value of the specified property and then updates it when
the source value changes. It is also smart enough to figure out how to subscribe to change events on
the target attribute and update the data source appropriately. For DOM elements it will subscribe to
the change event in the case of an input element. When the input element raises the change event,
for example due to the user typing in a value and then blurring, the source property will be set to
the new value.

Example:
```html
<input type="text" sys:value="{binding Text}" />
```

Additional options:
- `source` - By default the source property or path is evaluated against the current template data
source, i.e. `$dataItem`. You can pass a `source` object to override this behavior. The value of
this option must be the actual object, so typically it must be surrounded with `{{ }}` in order to
evaluate the source as a JavaScript expression.
	- `sys:value="{ binding SomeProperty, source={{ window.data }} }"`
- `mode` - Specify `oneWay` or `oneTime` if reactivity is not desired.
- `convert`: Function to convert the path value into the desired format, for example to produce an
appropriate string value (i.e. custom formatting).
	- `sys:value="{ binding SomeNumber, convert={{ function(n) { return n*5; } }} }"`
- `convertBack`: Function to convert a new value from the target (ex: new text that was typed in)
into the desired source value (i.e. custom parsing).
	- `sys:value="{ binding Num, convertBack={{ function(t) { return parseNumber(t); } }} }"`

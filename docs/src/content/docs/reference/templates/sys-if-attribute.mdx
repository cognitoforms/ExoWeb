<Aside type="caution">
The `sys:if` syntax only works when used within a _template context_.

You cannot use reactive `{binding}` extensions with `sys:if` - only literal `{{ }}` expressions.
</Aside>

The `sys:if` syntax can be used to conditionally render a particular element in a template.

If the expression in the attribute represents a _truthy_ value, then the element will be present in
the DOM, otherwise it will not be present in the DOM.

Example:

```html
<div sys:if="{{ $context.data.showContent }}">
	Some content
</div>
```

As with everything in MS Ajax templates, the template markup is initially present in the DOM. When
the DOM is activated the template is compiled and the original template elements are removed from
the DOM. The compiled template function is then used to generate new data-driven DOM content, and
the `sys:if` translates directly into a JavaScript `if` statement in the template function, i.e.:

```js
if ( $context.data.showContent ) {
	// Create and append <div> to the DOM
	// Set div content to "Some content"
}
```

For this reason, the `sys:if` expression can't be a dynamic binding. There is nothing for the
binding to target. Either the template produced a DOM element or it did not.

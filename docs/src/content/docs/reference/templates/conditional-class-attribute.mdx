title: Conditional class attribute
description: An attribute that adds a css class if an expression is truthy.
---

CSS classes can be dynamically applied to an element using the following syntax:

```html
<div sys:class-classname="{binding}">
```

If the value of the binding or expression is true, then the value after "class-"
is _added_ to the element as a CSS class, if it is false, then the class name is removed.

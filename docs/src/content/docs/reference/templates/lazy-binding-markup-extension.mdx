title: Lazy binding markup extension
description: A markup extension that supports lazy loading.
---

The `{~}` markup extension (called "lazy binding") supports one-way reactive data binding with
support for lazy loading.

It was originally created as a way to lazy-load data when needed, but additional functionality was
also added over time which make it useful for other reasons

Example:
```html
<div dataview:data="{~ Some.Path}">
```

Additional options:
- `format`: how to format the property value
- `transform`: for transforming list properties using functions like where, select, orderBy, etc. -
  see [available transforms](https://github.com/cognitoforms/ExoWeb/blob/master/ExoWeb/Client/src/base/core/Transform.js#L102).
- `nullValue`: value to use if the value is null
- `required`: allows for loading and watching for changes to additional values
